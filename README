Nagios 3.x README
-----------------


Nagios is a host/service/network monitoring program written in C and
released under the GNU General Public License.  CGI programs are
included to allow you to view the current status, history, etc via
a web interface if you so desire.

Features:

1) Monitoring of network services (via SMTP, POP3, HTTP, PING, etc).
2) A plugin interface to allow for user-developed service monitoring methods.
3) Notifications when problems occur and get resolved (via email, pager,
   or user-defined method).
4) Ability to define "event handlers" for proactive problem resolution
5) Web output (current status, notifications, problem history, log file, etc.)
6) Automatic log file rotation/archiving

For installation instructions, use a web browser to read the HTML documentation
in the html/docs subdirectory.

About Nagios-amq-perf
-------------------
This is a small fork from the venilla nagios core, the highlight feature
of this fork is enable the user posting performance data(Service Check ONLY now) to ActiveMQ for further handling.

To build nagios-amq-perf, you need the libstomp library, which is a simple STOMP library writen in C. It can be downloaded from here, 
http://svn.codehaus.org/stomp/trunk/c
Or I will publish the libstomp on github soon.

TODO
------------------------
1. Use libstomp++ to enhancement the AtiveMQ support;
2. Nagios Core upstream integration;
